Ok so we have some problems with the data and missing data. This is not great. Might cut the year catagory as none of these guys were consitant with years. Might examine intake versus 
euthanized colored by adoption. For missing data I will adverage the collomn and suplenemt the adverage into the space below. I wish I could at least have years but alas the years given
are all over the place.

Plan of attack, Cut year collumn, find adverages and fill in missing data, plot the data, sucess! 

I think a scatter plot will be best. We will try it.


Change of plan. Cutting the year and adopted section as bith aren't great and the intake vs Euthanized is better data. going to change the Humane society to 7 as an adverage



Here is the code I ran through R

```{r b}
personal_data <- read.csv("personal_data.csv")
library(GGally)


ggplot(data = personal_data, mapping = aes(x=intake, y=euthanized)) + geom_point()


```
